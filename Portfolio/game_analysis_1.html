                <article class="h-entry e-content">
                    <p>
                        <cite>Coffee Talk (2020)></cite> is a visual novel by <cite>Toge Productions</cite> (in Unity Engine), whereby the
                        player is a barista to a coffee shop that only opens at night. The player brews coffee and
                        listens to customers(mix of human and non-human, such as elves and succubi) unveil stories
                        with a warm cup or two. The game has story-driven gameplay by focusing on character
                        interactions and storytelling, with players learning about the lives and struggles of fantastical
                        beings in an alternative Seattle. Instead of the branching narratives being traditional dialogue
                        choices, the branching paths are influenced by how players serve drinks, adding a unique
                        twist to the genre. This allows players to influence the story through drink preparation, which
                        serves as a form of interaction rather than direct dialogue choices. As <cite>Jose P. Zagal (2010)</cite>
                        mentions, <q>to better understand a game it is important to understanding its components, how
                        they interact, and how they facilitate certain experiences in players</q> <cite>(Zagal, 2010, p.33)</cite>. This
                        essay explores how Coffee Talk innovates the visual novel genre by using drink preparation
                        as the main decision-making mechanic, replacing traditional dialogue choices. This will be
                        done by using Zagal’s <q>Ludoliteracy</q> lens <cite>(Zagal, 2010)</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The brewing mechanic is one of the core mechanics of the game. To brew, players use certain
                        ingredients for certain drinks, and players can serve drinks containing 4 statuses:
                        warm/cool/sweet/bitter <cite>(Toge Productions, 2019)</cite>. This affects the dialogue that follows, since
                        the customers comment on the drink served. (e.g. the werewolf Gala, who requires a
                        werewolf remedy to calm his fury close to the full moon, and only tells you keywords, and it
                        is up to the player to guess the correct ingredients.) The brewing becomes light
                        puzzle-solving through interpretive reasoning by interpreting what the player wants (if the
                        player says I want something that is “sweet and warm”).

                            <figcaption>Screenshot from Coffee Talk(2020) from Toge Productions</figcaption>
                        </figure> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A moment of frivolous play that adds to the coffee shop immersion is when the players can
                        add their latte art onto a drink before serving (provided the drink has milk as an ingredient).
                        Interesting to mention, in the latte art mechanic, there is a fluid simulation which is the
                        consistency and the flow of milk when it is poured to create a latte art <cite>(Lasheli Dwitri
                        Witjaksana, 2019)</cite>. This means that the outcome of the art is dependent on the player and not
                        just some automated art. This is an optional creative feature that adds play to the atmosphere.

                        <figure>
                            <img class=" img-design" src="../Images/Portfolio/Game Analysis/coffee_talk_2.png" alt="Screenshot of gameplay showing the latte art mechanic. Top down biew of the coffee and UI showing features like 'pour milk', 'reset', 'serve it'.">
                            <figcaption>Screenshot from Coffee Talk(2020) from Toge Productions</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These mechanics, combined with the dialogue, are what build relationships and branch the
                        story further. This can be tracked by the phone system, which basically tracks people's posts
                        and is a great way of keeping track of who you've met in the game and who you have yet to
                        meet. In accord with Zagal, <q>In addition to being able to pick out elements of a game’s
                        design, it is important to understand how the interaction between these elements helps create
                        a certain experience for the player</q> <cite>(Zagal, 2010, p.33)</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now the game balances the mechanics by revolving the mechanics around its barista
                        simulation elements, such as allowing the player to do the drink preparation and latte art, but
                        having a no-fail drinks system. This system ensures every drink is valid, though some may
                        not meet customer expectations. This avoids frustration while still encouraging
                        experimentation <cite>(Toge Productions, 2019)</cite>. The balance lies in how the mechanics enhance
                        the storytelling, such as the act of brewing coffee. It is not just a gameplay feature, but a
                        narrative tool that shapes character interactions and story outcomes. While the mechanics are
                        relatively simple, they are deeply tied to the dynamics of listening, empathy, and
                        relationship-building. This ensures that neither aspect overshadows the other but instead
                        works in harmony to deliver a unique experience. By blending these elements seamlessly,
                        Coffee Talk creates an experience where gameplay mechanics serve as a vehicle for
                        storytelling, making it more than just a visual novel or a simulation game.

                        <figure>
                            <img class=" img-design" src="../Images/Portfolio/Game Analysis/coffee_talk_3.png" alt="Screenshot of gameplay showing the player serving the coffee">
                            <figcaption>Screenshot from Coffee Talk(2020) from Toge Productions</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       Together, this creates an interesting dynamic that focuses on storytelling and character
                        interaction by adding narrative depth, atmosphere again and character relationship. The
                        narrative depth includes the game’s usage of the visual novel format, where players listen to
                        customers' stories and help them through meaningful conversations. The absence of direct
                        dialogue choices shifts the focus to how drinks influence character moods and story
                        progression. <cite>(Gamedeveloper.com, 2018)</cite> Secondly, the atmosphere is a cozy coffee shop
                        setting, lo-fi music, and pixel art visuals that create a relaxing environment, complementing
                        the narrative-driven gameplay <cite>(Gamedeveloper.com, 2018)</cite>. Lastly, the character
                        relationships within the game are moulded by interactions with fantastical characters,
                        allowing players to build relationships and explore societal themes like social class and
                        personal struggles in a subtle manner. (Like the sucubis and the elves’ relationship, whereby
                        the elf’s family doesn’t approve of the succubus). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       This ties into how the theme is executed and how they contribute to the overall experience. It
                        is not just apparent through narrative, but also illustrated through aesthetics, mechanics, and
                        system <cite>(Lasheli Dwitri Witjaksana, 2019)</cite>. This means that the impact of 90s pixel art with
                        anime-inspired graphics art direction and the Lofi chill-hop tunes reinforces that experience
                        of a coffee shop that is also a safe place for stories to be heard. It is also hard to miss the
                        societal themes that are subtly conveyed through fantastical narratives, engaging players in
                        thoughtful reflection. I particularly enjoyed how the main customer is a writer who is writing
                        a book about a world with only humans. The other characters find that idea crazy, but she
                        then mentions that while humans will be the only race, there is still a way that certain topics
                        still arise (such as race, class, etc). And it is an interesting dynamic to see because those
                        topics are still present within that fictional world of different races (humans, elves) and
                        classes.
 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This creates a unique visual novel experience. As reported by Zagal, <q>to understand a game,
                        it is often important to understand its context with relation to other games as well as gaming
                        conventions and mechanics that might be common across multiple genres</q> <cite>(Zagal, 2010,
                        p.31)</cite>. Visual novels are characterised by narrative-driven gameplay, often with branching
                        storylines and player choices. Coffee Talk follows these conventions through story-driven
                        gameplay and branching narratives while also following the sub-genre of interactive fiction
                        and simulation by emphasising storytelling combined with player interaction. However, it
                        diverges in the sense that, unlike typical visual novels, Coffee Talk avoids dialogue trees and
                        instead uses drink-making as the primary decision-making mechanic. <cite>(Giant Bomb, 2022)</cite>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Coffee Talk innovates the visual novel genre by using drink preparation as the main
                        decision-making mechanic, replacing traditional dialogue choices. This approach deepens
                        player engagement, fosters empathy, and supports storytelling, while its cozy atmosphere and
                        subtle social themes create a uniquely immersive and reflective experience.
