                    <p>
                        In an industry saturated with single-player narratives and online multiplayer experiences, It
                        Takes Two (2021) stands out as a textbook example in cooperative gameplay and imaginative
                        level design. Developed by Hazelight Studios, the game is built entirely around the concept
                        of two players working in tandem, both narratively and mechanically. Rather than treating
                        co-op as an optional mode, It Takes Two integrates collaboration as a core design philosophy,
                        creating gameplay moments that are impossible to overcome alone. As Jose P. Zagal (2010)
                        mentions, “to better understand a game it is important to understanding its components, how
                        they interact, and how they facilitate certain experiences in players” (Zagal, 2010, p.33). This
                        essay explores how the game’s narrative and mechanics are tightly interwoven, emphasising
                        the importance of collaboration and communication within relationships. This will be
                        illustrated by focusing on Chapter 1 of the game (“The Shed”) and by using Zagal’s
                        “Ludoliteracy” lens (Zagal, 2010).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It Takes Two is a co-operative adventure game centred around May and Cody, a couple on the
                        brink of divorce. They magically transform into dolls by their daughter Rose’s wish. Chapter
                        1: “The Shed” serves as the game’s introduction to both its story and its core cooperative
                        gameplay mechanics. This can be illustrated through the narrative context and themes.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                       The narrative context and themes are shown throughout gameplay moments. The story begins
                        with May and Cody informing their daughter Rose of their impending divorce, which
                        prompts Rose to wish for her parents to reconcile. Her tears then animate her handmade dolls
                        of her parent, trapping their consciousness inside these figures. This journey is checkpointed
                        by Dr. Hakim, who is the anthropomorphic Book of Love, who also appears as a guide and
                        therapist, insisting that the couple must work together to return to their human form. This
                        dynamic ensures that the co-op mechanics are narratively tied into the theme, emphasising
                        the importance of collaboration and communication with relationships. This ensures that
                        Chapter 1 sets the emotional tone, highlighting the couple’s bitterness and inability to
                        communicate effectively. Their bickering is mirrored in the narrative and gameplay while
                        they overcome obstacles that require cooperation. During gameplay, the dialogue between both 
                        characters includes so much bickering. This can be illustrated in the gameplay
                        mechanics as well. For instance, when a player throws something at the other, the following
                        dialogue is something along the lines of “Oh Cody, grow up”.

                        </figure>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       This moves us onto the gameplay mechanics. Gameplay in Chapter 1 is designed as a series
                        of puzzles and platforming challenges that can only be solved through collaboration. Each
                        player controls one character (between May and Cody), and progression is impossible
                        without both players actively participating. Early challenges include repairing a broken
                        vacuum and navigating challenging environments in the shed. These challenges force players
                        to communicate and synchronise their actions, reflecting the couple’s need to rebuild trust
                        and partnership. The mechanics often require asymmetric cooperation, where each character
                        has unique abilities or tools that complement the other. Like the challenge where one person
                        operates the hammer while the other uses the nails, emphasising interdependence. This
                        narrative-mechanic integration is what creates the balance within the game.

                            uses the hammer to swing on them to get past.</figcaption>
                        </figure> 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The obstacles in Chapter 1 are not just physical but metaphorical representations of the
                        couple’s relationship issues. For instance, the players have to repair a broken vacuum cleaner,
                        but it’s still a direct callback to an earlier argument, turning their domestic disputes into literal
                        gameplay challenges. This takes the level design and challenges reinforce the message that
                        progress (both in the game and in their relationship) is only possible through teamwork and
                        empathy. Failure to cooperate results in setbacks, sort of mirroring the consequences of poor
                        communication in real relationships.

                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       The above-mentioned core mechanics all include elements that intertwine with collaboration.
                        This includes the synchronised actions such as the puzzles that require precise timing and
                        communication, obstacles that require both players to perform unique complementary actions
                        and tool-based abilities. This is a good point to bring up a point Zagal makes, “In addition to
                        being able to pick out elements of a game’s design, it is important to understand how the
                        interaction between these elements helps create a certain experience for the player”(Zagal,
                        2010, p.33). These mechanics create a dynamic balance of co-operation and communication.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       The art direction features whimsical, oversized objects highlighting the characters’
                        dependence on each other to overcome obstacles. The soundscape combines playful music
                        with voice acting to capture the couple’s bickering and gradual reconciliation, providing
                        narrative context that motivates players to work together, mirroring their in-game
                        cooperation. Together, the art and sound design create a cohesive sensory experience that
                        constantly reminds players of their mutual reliance. The visual scale and interactive elements
                        frame the players as small and vulnerable, while the sound design provides emotional and
                        practical cues that require attention and teamwork.

                        </figure>
 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This creates a system that emphasises collaboration. As stated by Zagal, “to understand a
                        game, it is often important to understand its context with relation to other games as well as
                        gaming conventions and mechanics that might be common across multiple genres” (Zagal,
                        2010, p.31). It Takes Two strongly follows the conventions of an action-adventure game with
                        strong platforming elements while also following the sub-genre of cooperative
                        puzzle-platforming. However, it diverges in the sense that it is purely co-op with varied
                        gameplay within Levels. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In summary, Chapter 1 of It Takes Two effectively introduces the game’s core theme of
                        collaboration through tightly integrated narrative and gameplay. The asymmetric mechanics
                        and cooperative challenges reflect the emotional tension between Cody and May, turning
                        their relationship struggles into engaging gameplay. Viewed through Zagal’s lens, the chapter
                        demonstrates how game elements work together to create a meaningful and reflective co-op
                        experience that sets the tone for the rest of the game.
