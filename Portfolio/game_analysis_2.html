                <article class="h-entry e-content">
                    

                    <p>
                        <cite>Phasmophobia (2020)</cite> is an Indie horror game developed by Kinetic Games. Moving beyond
                        traditional jump scares, Phasmophobia is an immersive experience that is more
                        psychologically driven. This shift is exemplified by placing the players in the role of
                        paranormal investigators tasked with identifying various types of ghosts in haunted locations.
                        What sets Phasmophobia apart is its innovative use of cooperative multiplayer mechanics,
                        environmental storytelling, and voice recognition technology to create an atmosphere of
                        sustained dread. As <cite>Jose P. Zagal (2010)</cite> says, <q>to better understand a game it is important to
                        understanding its components, how they interact, and how they facilitate certain experiences
                        in players</q> <cite>(Zagal, 2010, p.33)</cite>. This essay explores how Phasmophobia leverages audio
                        design and gameplay that comes from unexpected and unscripted situations to craft a
                        uniquely unsettling experience that redefines fear in games using the <q>Ludoliteracy</q> lens by
                        <cite>Zagal (2010)</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This first-person psychological horror offers multiplayer co-op for up to 4 players, though it
                        does support solo play for the brave of heart. They have a particularly interesting way of
                        using co-op mechanics from teamwork-centric gameplay to risk and reward through shared
                        vulnerability. Players need to gather evidence. They can then divide these tasks, creating
                        interdependent roles that require coordination. These tasks include evidence gathering using
                        tools such as spirit boxes, thermometers, cameras, and EMF (electromagnetic fields)readers.
                        Players then share their findings and communicate via proximity voice chat. Together, these
                        become essential for strategy and survival, as ghosts can hear players and react accordingly.
                        Additionally, the longer players stay in the haunted location, the higher the risk (lower sanity,
                        thus more likely to get attacked by a ghost), but also the potential rewards. Players are then
                        rewarded with experience (XP) and money by correctly identifying ghosts and completing
                        optional objectives, which in turn unlock larger maps and better equipment. This, paired with
                        environmental storytelling, allows players to gain risk and reward through shared
                        vulnerability to ghost attacks and sanity effects (players have a sanity meter that decreases
                        over time and with ghost interactions).

                    <p>
                       This moves us onto environmental storytelling in Phasmophobia. They employ
                        environmental storytelling in a way that creates a deeply immersive and unsettling
                        atmosphere that enhances the horror experience through subtle, non-verbal narrative cues
                        built within its game environments. This means that level design in the haunted locations
                        includes features such as dim lighting, flickering lights, dark corners, and ominous fog (when
                        the temperature drops and you’re currently in the ghost room). While the art direction
                        includes a low-budget realism with high psychological impact, it avoids overt horror tropes in
                        favour of subtle, slow-building tension through lighting, realistic environments, and
                        understated visual scares. Together, these contribute to the art direction of a tense,
                        suspenseful mood, which adds to the atmospheric design that showcases the theme of the
                        game. Another way that Phasmophobia conveys environmental narrative is through sound.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                       Sound forms a big part of Phasmophobia’s game system. It is used built-in from mechanics
                        such as voice recognition technology to audio design. The voice recognition tech in
                        Phasmophobia allows players to ask questions aloud and provoke ghost responses, making
                        encounters feel reactive and immersive. As a result, ghosts can also respond or hunt players
                        based on what is said, which adds to the fear factor that the player gets when interacting with
                        the mechanic. This forms part of the audio design of the game.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another aspect of Phasmophobia’s audio design, which is central to its atmosphere, is the
                        way that it uses both the presence and absence of sound to induce dread. There’s actually a
                        nearly inaudible ambient "room tone" - a low, airy hum present in most maps, and this kind of
                        creates a subtle uneasiness that conditions players to fear its absence, signalling imminent
                        danger (scares the jesus out of people). This intentional omission of the hum in certain maps,
                        like the asylum, manipulates player expectations, making environments feel emptier and
                        more oppressive, like the ghost can be anywhere
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       This moves us onto the game’s soundscape, which includes carefully crafted environmental
                        noises such as creaking doors, distant footsteps, flickering electricity, and ghostly
                        vocalisations like laughing, crying, or breathing. These sounds vary in intensity and
                        proximity, forcing players to constantly question what is real and what is supernatural.
                        During ghost hunts, signature audio cues- ranging from eerie singing to a frantic kind of
                        growl- escalate tension dramatically. By pairing this with sudden radio silence, the game
                        disrupts player communication and heightens panic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       According to <cite>Zagal</cite>, <q>In addition to being able to pick out elements of a game’s design, it is
                        important to understand how the interaction between these elements helps create a certain
                        experience for the player</q> <cite>(Zagal, 2010, p.33)</cite>. Phasmophobia balances the game interactions
                        with proximity-based voice chat that adds realism and immersion. This means that players
                        can hear each other only when they are close, with radios often cutting out during hunts,
                        emphasising isolation and vulnerability. This is also shown when ghosts can whisper or
                        breathe directly into players’ ears (especially before you die in the game). Thus, contributing
                        to the game's theme of creating intimate, terrifying moments that leverage spatial audio to
                        maximise fear. Phasmophobia creates Ludoliteracy by combining the aforementioned with
                        the core gameplay mechanic (emergent gameplay) to create player experience and
                        engagement within the game <cite>(Zagal, 2010, p.17)</cite>.
 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Emergent gameplay is gameplay that comes from unexpected and unscripted situations. This
                        comes in the form of dynamic ghost behaviour, whereby different ghost types have unique
                        behaviours and hunting patterns, requiring players to adapt their investigation strategies each
                        session (such as the Raiju that interferes with electronics). Paranormal activity increases over
                        time, influencing ghost aggression and evidence availability. Now, Phasmophobia’s emergent
                        gameplay arises from its complex systems and player-driven interactions. Players use
                        real-world ghost-hunting tools- EMF readers, spirit boxes, thermometers, cameras, crucifixes,
                        and smudge sticks- to gather evidence and provoke ghosts. The voice recognition technology
                        allows ghosts to respond to player speech, making encounters feel reactive and personalised.
                        Aggressive or crude language can anger ghosts, triggering hunts, which adds a layer of
                        consequence to player behaviour. Phasmophobia combines this with the randomness of ghost
                        types to increase engagement.

                    <p>
                        The randomness of ghost types, each with unique behaviours and hunting patterns, ensures
                        that no two sessions are alike, adding to the replayability. Players must adapt strategies on the
                        fly, balancing investigation thoroughness with survival instincts. This unpredictability fosters
                        emergent social dynamics, such as deciding when to split up or regroup, and managing sanity
                        levels to avoid hunts. Besides, it’s always fun throwing a friend under a bus during a ghost
                        hunt.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This creates a unique horror experience for the player. As reported by <cite>Zagal</cite>, <q>to understand a
                        game, it is often important to understand its context with relation to other games as well as
                        gaming conventions and mechanics that might be common across multiple genres</q> <cite>(Zagal,
                        2010, p.31)</cite>. Survival horror is characterised by hostile environments, limited resources and
                        atmosphere and sound design. Phasmophobia follows these conventions while also following
                        a sub-genre of psychological horror (fear of the uncertain/unseen) and puzzle elements
                        (gather clues and identify the ghost type). However, it diverges in the sense that, unlike most
                        horror games where players avoid threats, Phasmophobia requires players to actively seek
                        them out and interact with them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, Phasmophobia redefines horror through immersive co-op gameplay, reactive
                        audio, and emergent mechanics. Its use of voice recognition, environmental storytelling, and
                        unpredictable ghost behaviour creates a tense, psychological experience. The game’s subtle
                        art direction and realistic sound design build fear through atmosphere rather than jump scares,
                        making each session feel unique, immersive, and deeply unsettling.
                    </p>
