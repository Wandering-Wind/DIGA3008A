                <h3>FOLDER STRUCTURE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Does my folder structure reflect the hierarchical information structure of my content? <br>
                        Yes, my folder structure mirrors the hierarchy of the site content. Each main section of 
                        the website (portfolio, designs, blogs) is organized into its own subfolder, which supports 
                        clear navigation and scalability.
                        Assets such as my images are also grouped logically. All images go to one folder, where 
                        there are subfolders for each section of the website that requires images 
                        (e.g., Images folder > Portfolio > Game_Analysis > air_hockey.png). 
                        This helps maintain a meaningful structure that aligns with my site layout and user journey.
                        The root of the project contains the index files, and each section branches off into folders from there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Does it separate concerns: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (data layer, logic layer, and presentation layer)? <br>
                        Yes, the website follows separation where concerned. HTML files are placed in the root or sections folders
                         and contain content and semantic markup.
                        The main CSS file that is shared by every section is stored in the "Styles" folder, whereas particular 
                        styling that should be different to each page or section is in their respective folders 
                        (e.g. designs.css will be in the Designs folder with the designs.html)
                        JavaScript files follow the same layout as CSS layouts. Main shared JS is located in the "Scripts" 
                        folder, whereas the rest are organized by their respective sections to handle logic and interactivity. 
                        This separation ensures better maintainability and clarity for me.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is it modular and scalable?<br>
                        Yes, the structure is modular and uses consistent naming conventions. 
                        File names have the first letter Uppercase and words seperated by a "_". 
                        File names are all lowercase, separated by "_" and follow the snake case naming convention. 
                        This convention increases readability. Components such as cards or navigation elements are designed to be reusable. 
                        This modularity makes the site easy to scale as more sections and features are added, and 
                        the naming conventions support both human readability and long-term maintenance.
                        Images follow a convention according to where they belong: blog_week_7_dischem_con4 (pros and cons images).

                    </p>

                    <h3>SEMANTIC MARKUP</h3>
                    <p>
                        Is my markup providing sufficient context and information to the browser for my user?<br>
                        Yes, mostly. Elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, 
                        &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;figcaption&gt;, and &lt;time&gt; are examples 
                        of semantic HTML being correctly used. The use of meta tags (author, description, viewport) also contributes to improved context and SEO.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Are my interface elements expressed fully and correctly?<br>
                        Mostly, yes. Navigation elements are appropriately grouped using &lt;nav&gt;, 
                        with clearly labelled links. The layout for the burger menu is solid for responsiveness. 
                        Buttons are correctly named and marked &lt;button&gt; for readability (e.g. #toTopBtn).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is my content expressed fully and correctly? <br>
                        Yes, to the best of my ability. The use of &lt;article&gt; and &lt;h1&gt; with h-entry, p-author, 
                        dt-published (microformats) enhances semantic meaning and machine readability. 
                        Each section, like User Alignment, User Experience, and References, 
                        is logically structured with appropriate headings (&lt;h3&gt;) and paragraphs. 
                        All content is expressed fully, and no content is cut off by layout or anything like that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What usability can be augmented by the use of semantic markup?<br>
                        Keyboard navigation and screen reader usability are greatly enhanced. 
                        For example, &lt;nav&gt; helps assistive tech skip to menus, and &lt;article&gt; 
                        allows screen readers to announce blog content distinctly. Semantic HTML improves SEO, 
                        ensuring crawlers can better understand my structure and rank my content accordingly. 
                        &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; together help describe visuals in context, aiding both human and machine users.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Where can the use of semantic markup improve accessibility?<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;: Defines document regions for screen readers. </li>
                            <li>&lt;time datetime&gt;: Communicates exact publishing date in machine-readable format. </li> 
                            <li>&lt;article class="h-entry"&gt;: Microformats help with web syndication, search engine display, and accessibility.</li>  
                            <li>&lt;a class="p-author h-card"&gt;: Supports microdata for authorship metadata.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>METADATA</h3>
                    <p>
                        Am I including sufficient metadata to guide the browser in interpreting my content?<br>
                        Yes. My metadata includes:  
                        <ul>
                        <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - Correctly declares HTML5 document type.</li> 
                        <li>&lt;html lang="en"&gt; - Sets the document language to English. </li> 
                        <li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; - Ensures correct character encoding (UTF-8).</li>  
                        <li>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt; - Enables responsive design. </li> 
                        <li>&lt;meta name="author" content="Amina Moosa"&gt; - Provides authorship information.  </li>
                        <li>&lt;meta name="description" content="Blog week 3 about Interaction Design and a web-style guide"&gt; - Supports SEO and sharing. </li> 
                        <li>&lt;title&gt; is descriptive and accurate for that specific page content.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Have I identified content that requires metadata?<br>
                        Yes, mostly. I've set the page language: <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code>. I've set the author, myself, Author: <code>&lt;meta name="author" content="Amina Moosa"&gt;</code> <br>
                        Other content requiring metadata is appropriately marked up, for example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blog post metadata is expressed using Microformats (<code>h-entry</code>, <code>p-name</code>, <code>p-author</code>, <code>dt-published</code>, etc.) – This is great for semantic clarity and can be picked up by search engines and assistive tech.</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;link rel="icon" href="..."&gt;</code> – Gives my site a favicon.</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="..."&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script src="..."&gt;</code> – External resources are correctly linked.</li>
                            <li>Font loading uses preconnect, improving performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is my metadata expressed fully and correctly? <br>
                        Yes, mostly. My metadata tags are placed within the &lt;head&gt; element. The attributes are spelled and closed properly. 
                        I make use of semantic microformats (e.g., h-entry, p-author, dt-published). 
                        My font loading and icons are optimized via preconnect. External links are marked as class="u-url" in references.
                    </p>

                    <h3>CSS</h3>

                    <p>
                        Am I avoiding in-line styles and using CSS to create consistent styling throughout my website?  <br>
                        Yes, mostly. Most styling uses CSS, such as the font and layout or colour. 
                        This promotes reusability and helps with cleaner code. I use classes and IDs defined in external CSS sheets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is it modular and retainable?  <br>
                        Yes, mostly. My CSS is modular since it improves scalability through the use of responsive design for pages and images. 
                        It is also maintainable, since all the repeated styling appears in the main CSS to avoid repetition and prevent styles 
                        from breaking when adding new features.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Am I using responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices?  <br>
                        Yes, mostly. This matters since users visit websites on phones, tablets, and laptops, and my layout is flexible enough to adapt. 
                        I use media queries to adjust the layout for different viewports. I set widths in percentages where appropriate.
                    </p>

                    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>

                    <p>
                        Am I expressing interaction points and functionality using JS? (through event handling and DOM manipulation?) <br> 
                        I’m effectively using event listeners and DOM manipulation to handle interaction points.  
                        DOMContentLoaded: Multiple instances to ensure the DOM is loaded before attaching behaviour such as transitions between pages.  
                        Button click: .readmore-btn and navigation buttons (prevBtn, nextBtn) trigger logic on click.  
                        SVG animation: I’m dynamically creating and animating SVG elements for the page beam effect, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>Event handling example:  <br>
                        There is one click event listener bound in my JS file:  
                        <code>button.addEventListener("click", function () {  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" });  
                        });</code>  <br>
                        This is inside the DOMContentLoaded event handler for the element with id "toTopBtn." 
                        It triggers smooth scrolling to the top of the page when that button is clicked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Which interaction points and functionalities are repeated? Can they be separated out and consolidated?  <br>
                        Interaction points and functionalities that are repeated include the prevBtn and nextBtn, since they all require 
                        an array of files from that specific folder. The transitions that are repeated are slightly varied across sections. 
                        Other than that, interactions for specific sections are in their respective sections .js files.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Am I avoiding in-line scripting and linking through to the JS?  <br>
                        Yes. I'm avoiding inline scripting correctly, there's no inline JS in my HTML. 
                        All logic is externalized to .js files and executed using event listeners, 
                        which is good practice for maintainability, security (avoiding inline execution), and separation of concerns.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Am I using async requests to reduce redownloading and improve performance and UX?  
                        Yes, for my API, since it improves performance and reduces full-page reloads.
