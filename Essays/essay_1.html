                <article class="h-entry e-content">
                    <p>
                        While interaction on the web is structured through the user interface (UI) and (UX), the ethics
                        of the interaction design can be deliberated since the way users interact with websites is
                        largely shaped by the principles of UI/UX design. These elements not only determine how
                        information is presented and navigated but also influence the accessibility, inclusivity, and
                        ethical considerations embedded within digital platforms. This essay attempts to examine the
                        Dischem website, a well-known South African pharmacy, as a case study to analyse how its
                        UI and UX structures web interactions. The analysis will explore the effectiveness of its
                        design choices, the inclusivity of its user experience, and the ethical implications of its
                        interaction design by particularly focusing on accessibility, transparency, and digital
                        inclusion. By examining the Dischem website within the context of ethical interaction design,
                        this essay aims to highlight both the strengths and areas for improvement when creating
                        design experiences that serve all users. This will primarily be achieved by using the following
                        frameworks as a source: <cite>“Ethical UX Design and User Trust: Why It Matters?”</cite> by <cite>Aparna K.
                        S</cite>, and lastly, <cite>“Ethical Design: Why Is It Critical for UX Designers?”</cite> by <cite>Juned Ghanchi</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <cite>Aparna K.S.</cite> describes UX in design ethics as <q>the moral guidelines that shape our design
                        decisions</q>, then goes on to further explain that these principles serve the users' best interests
                        instead of taking advantage of them, whether deliberately or unintentionally <cite>(Aparna K.S.,
                        2024)</cite>. This takes us to the question: What is UI? UI is a point where humans interact and
                        communicate with a computer or device. It encompasses elements such as display screens,
                        keyboards, a mouse, etc. However, this can also refer to how users may engage with
                        applications or, in this case, websites, through visual and auditory components ranging from
                        visual design or input controls to sound effects. Thus, an effective UI follows key design
                        principles that help users navigate smoothly and accomplish their goals with ease. This goes
                        hand-in-hand with UX. <cite>(Hashemi-Pour and Churchville, 2024)</cite>   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        UX describes the emotions and understanding that users have when interacting with a
                        product, application, service, or, in this case, website. While it is a broad concept that
                        encompasses factors such as ease of navigation and usability, it also represents the complete
                        journey a user goes through while using a particular product or website service <cite>(ProductPlan,
                        2024)</cite>. Therefore, it not only involves their direct interactions but also considers how the
                        website service supports their broader goals and tasks <cite>(ProductPlan, 2024)</cite>. Together, they
                        become essential when creating effective, engaging, and user-friendly design experiences for
                        all users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Therefore, by analysing the UI and UX of the Dischem website, it can be shown how the site
                        structures interaction and addresses ethical considerations in its design. Dischem is the
                        second-largest pharmacy chain in South Africa, and it demonstrates a utilitarian approach to
                        UI/UX design with room for improvement. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The UI design for Dischem consists of information organisation, category-based navigation,
                        responsive design and compositional layouts. The visual design layout for their product
                        organisation is extensive, providing an easy navigation for users and their specific needs. It is
                        worth mentioning that product organisation ranges from category to being able to filter
                        according to price and discounts, which adds functionality to the website design. This method
                        of organisation simplifies the browsing experience for the user, allowing them to intuitively
                        navigate items quickly. In addition, the sections have category-based navigation, such as
                        "Easter Delights”, “Shop for Mother’s Day” or “Guard Against the Flu” (accounting for the
                        change in seasons), provide thematic organisation and allow users to navigate according to
                        seasons, keeping the user’s needs in mind. This adds to the ethical design usability, which
                        refers to how <q>efficiently and satisfactorily a user can accomplish a specific goal</q> <cite>(Ghanchi,
                        2021)</cite>. That being said, there is room for improvement in the UI of Dischem’s website, such
                        as the responsive design. The responsive design for the navigation bar, search bar, and
                        burger-button drop-down is inconsistent across different devices. The alignment of content is
                        also not consistent, from products to banners. During the Easter Season, the homepage of the
                        website showcased easter specials. However, these banners/images had different sizes,
                        resulting in blank white space and visual disharmony. With regards to products on the
                        homepage, the compositional layout was also inconsistent. Block cards for products would be
                        of the same size however, the product's image displayed would be of different sizes, not to
                        mention that the text on each block card started on different spaces on the block cards,
                        resulting in visual disharmony again. The product button on the block card would also be in
                        different spaces, thus producing disorientated users due to a frustrating layout. Concerning
                        banners, some would cut out the content text on the page, or layer it onto a product/image,
                        adding to a challenging UI to read and a UX of slight disorientation.

                    <p>
                        The UX design of the Dischem website prioritises transactional efficiency over engagement.
                        This echoes their pharmacy-first focus, whereby prescription management and health product
                        searches are streamlined, aligning with their core mission <cite>(Simplify.hr, 2016)</cite>. In addition,
                        their post-purchase tracking integration with AfterShip allows order tracking via confirmation
                        emails, reducing customer service inquiries <cite>(Team, 2020)</cite>. They do create convenience for
                        their users since they incorporate in-store perks as well, such as linking loyalty cards,
                        personalised recommendations, and notably, the ability to order medical prescriptions directly
                        through the app for collection at a selected store. This integrates pharmacy services, making
                        healthcare more accessible and convenient for users. Despite these strengths, the UX reveals
                        challenges in real-time communication and service consistency, with users reporting delays
                        and insufficient updates on order statuses. Accessibility features appear limited, this could
                        potentially exclude users with disabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, on the order tracking website, users are able to link back to the Dischem website,
                        view their returns policy, and view the tracking page. Some points of friction to note are the
                        cookie consent, whereby the banner’s minimal design may inadequately inform users about
                        data collection practices, leaning into design ethical considerations as well.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <figure>
                            <img class="img-essay" src="../Images/Essays/essay_1_dischem_10.png" alt="Screenshot of Dischem AirShip Tracking Website showing links to Dischem website, returns policy and tracking page">

                        </figure>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ethical considerations of Dischem meet basic compliance but include granular room for
                        improvement. The cookies policy complies with basic regulations but does not offer users
                        detailed controls over their data preferences. This means that health-related purchases, such
                        as medication, lack strict data privacy, which is not explicitly highlighted. While Dischem is
                        a business, another ethical consideration is its price integrity. This stems from the criticism
                        faced due to inflating mask prices during COVID-19 <cite>(Competition Tribunal, 2020)</cite>. With
                        regards to accessibility, the Dischem website has limited evidence of screen-reader
                        compatibility or alt-text for product images, excluding visually impaired users, but includes
                        phone support. In addition, while Dischem’s interface is primarily a white background, they
                        do not offer a dark mode, excluding users' “visual comfort levels” and lighting conditions
                        <cite>(Ghanchi, 2021)</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, Dischem’s UI/UX design demonstrates thoughtful integration of digital health
                        services but requires ongoing refinement in communication transparency, accessibility, and
                        user support to fully meet customer expectations and ethical standards. This concludes that
                        their UI/UX and ethical design meet compliance but have room for improvement. Lastly,
                        while their website design effectively serves its commercial goals, there is a need for
                        intentional shifts to prioritise user experience and inclusivity. By addressing these gaps, the
                        platform could reinforce its position as a trusted healthcare partner in South Africa.
