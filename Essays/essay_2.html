                <article class="h-entry e-content">
                    <p>
                        The internet, largely considered a space that does not have physical boundaries, is
                        nonetheless shaped by distinct geographies that can often mirror or even reinforce global
                        inequalities in power, representation, and access<cite>(Graham, 2014)</cite>. From this arises digital
                        coloniality, which describes how Western tech corporations show colonial patterns of control
                        and extraction into the digital world, thus shaping infrastructure, data flows, and knowledge
                        production to their advantage <cite>(Birhane, 2020)</cite>. Both <cite>Graham (2014) </cite>and <cite>Birhane (2020)</cite>
                        draw attention to the politics between the internet and digital colonialism and how they are
                        closely intertwined. They do this by exploring how the technologies and algorithms behind
                        our digital interactions often reinforce those patterns of inequality, just now in the digital form
                        of the internet. A clear example of the above stated will be studied in this essay is the
                        undersea cable outages in West Africa in March 2024, which exposed how digital
                        infrastructure is still deeply tied to geopolitical power dynamics and colonial history, thus
                        perpetuating systemic inequalities. This will be supported by the following frameworks:
                        <cite>Abebe Birhane in <q>Algorithmic Colonization of Africa</q> (2020)</cite>, <cite>Mark Graham in <q>Internet
                        Geographies </q>(2014)</cite>, and <cite>Christopher Lutz in <q>Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial
                        Intelligence and Big Data </q> (2019)</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On 14 March 2024, a suspected underwater rockslide off Côte d’Ivoire broke four major
                        submarine cables. The impact was massive, resulting in a “near-total internet outage” that hit
                        13 countries, including Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Liberia, and Ghana, while other countries like
                        Nigeria and South Africa experienced partial disruptions <cite>(Internet Society, 2024)</cite>.
                        This undersea cable blackout exposed the vulnerabilities in Africa’s digital and internet
                        infrastructure and thus showed how both environmental events and geopolitical realities can
                        bring entire regions offline, particularly those that are heavily reliant on external systems.
                        While regions like Europe managed to bounce back quickly, Africa’s repairs were delayed,
                        mainly because the necessary ships were European-based <cite>(Munga, 2025)</cite>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a result, key vulnerabilities were highlighted, such as the fact that the cable routes
                        mirrored historical trade paths created during the colonial era <cite>(Mwema, 2024)</cite>. Another key
                        highlight worth mentioning is the infrastructure centralization, meaning that most of Africa’s
                        internet traffic depends on undersea cables that are owned and controlled by Western tech
                        giants such as Meta and Google <cite>(Mwema et al., 2024)</cite>. This goes to show that infrastructure
                        today still follows historical colonial footprints. <cite>Birhane (2020)</cite> uses the term <q>algorithmic
                        colonialism,</q> basically describing how Africa is both separated from control and deeply
                        dependent on global tech firms <cite>(Birhane, 2020, p. 391)</cite>. Here is where the mirroring
                        happens; it mirrors a colonial relationship where resources and value flow out, yet risks and
                        instability remain on African nations. Consequently, the outages expose how little control
                        African nations have over their connectivity, therefore reinforcing a pattern of technological
                        dependency and exploitation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the topic of connectivity, when the blackout happened, it didn’t affect everyone equally. In
                        some cases, they amplified existing digital inequalities, especially for already vulnerable or
                        under-resourced countries. Mobile money platforms stalled, and people couldn’t transfer or
                        access money. As a consequence of this outage, businesses lost revenue due to online
                        sales, operations, or communications <cite>(Yusuf, 2024)</cite>. Impacts such as these are classed as
                        part of <cite>Lutz's (2019)</cite> digital inequalities framework, in which marginalized groups (already
                        lacking continuous connectivity) bear the brunt of these disruptions <cite>(Lutz, 2019, p. 143)</cite>. In
                        essence, these disruptions hit marginalized people and economies where those that had few
                        digital tools and less infrastructure suffered more. For instance, Ghana versus Europe is a
                        prime example of the <cite>Lutz’s</cite> <q>Third-Level Digital Divide</q> <cite>(Lutz, 2019, p. 144)</cite>. In this case,
                        Ghana took five weeks to fully repair its internet cables, in contrast to European countries
                        that recovered much faster from similar issues due to better infrastructure, funding, and
                        control <cite>(Internet Society, 2024)</cite>. This contrast illustrates <cite>Lutz’s</cite> <q>Third-Level Digital Divide,</q>
                        meaning it is not just about who has internet or who knows how to use it, but also who can
                        respond, adapt, and recover when something has gone wrong. This reflects the deeper
                        structural inequalities in digital inequality by illustrating that it is not just a tech failure but a
                        systemic imbalance in who controls, accesses, and benefits from these digital
                        infrastructures.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Post-outage, many called for <q>investment in redundancy</q>, in essence, the building of better
                        systems to avoid future blackouts <cite>(Yusuf, 2024)</cite>. However, with the proposed solutions of
                        backup cables or infrastructure upgrades, most of them are owned and controlled by
                        Western tech companies (like Meta or Google). This means that while they’re framed as
                        helping Africa, they actually deepen dependence and reinforce old colonial power dynamics.
                        This aligns with <cite>Mwema Mozilla’s</cite> concept of <q>digital colonialism,</q> whereby big tech firms
                        build infrastructure in the Global South, present it as generous or empowering, but as a
                        consequence, retain control, extract data and profits, and leave local communities with little
                        ownership <cite>(Mwema, 2024)</cite>. Thus, bringing back the point of mirroring colonial systems
                        whereby foreign powers build things to extract resources, not empower locals. This suggests
                        that corporate-owned solutions may improve technical performance, but they don’t address a
                        core issue: Africa still lacks sovereign control over its digital future. Hence, the term “digital
                        colonialism”, an updated version of old power structures, just using cables this time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the 2024 West African underwater cable outages showed us how the internet,
                        generally regarded as being physically borderless, is highly subject to distinctive geogaphies
                        that express geopolitical imbalances in power, representation, and access <cite>(Graham, 2014)</cite>.
                        <cite>Birhane (2020) </cite> and <cite>Graham (2014) </cite> both argue that Africa's digital infrastructure will continue
                        to be reflective of colonial patterns of control as long as Africa's connectivity continues to
                        heavily depend on Western-owned infrastructures. As a result, African nations are left with
                        little control but high vulnerability, a dynamic described as algorithmic colonialism. This
                        outage revealed digital inequalities. The delayed recovery in nations like Ghana was a
                        reflection of the <q>Third-Level Digital Divide,</q> and as a result, marginalized communities suffered
                        the most <cite>(Lutz, 2019)</cite>. Instead of addressing dependency, post-outage solutions focused on
                        infrastructure investments managed by Western companies. Without a move to regional data
                        sovereignty, Africa's technology future will still be shaped by digital colonialism, although with
                        new connections.
