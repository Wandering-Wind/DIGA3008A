                        Goal and aesthetic as a single statement: 
                        My portfolio blends futuristic, tech-inspired aesthetics with interactive design, 
                        showcasing my creativity, skills, and projects while inviting users to explore my work and experience 
                        my evolving style.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Expanded:
                        My portfolio website merges futuristic, tech-inspired aesthetics with interactive, 
                        dynamic design to showcase my creativity, skills and projects. With glowing, holographic elements and smooth, 
                        immersive navigation, I want the site to invite users to explore my work - from essays and blog insights to projects. 
                        It’s not just a showcase, but an experience: a digital playground where users engage with my creations, 
                        embodying the innovative spirit of game design and interactive media.

                        The visual design elements selected:
                        Aesthetic: Sort of a sleek, futuristic interfaced mixed with electric blue hues. 
                        For blogs, glowing cards that hover softly against a dark, metallic backdrop. 
                        Neon accents to trace the subtle lines of the layout, sort of resembling advanced HUD displays.
                    </p>

                        Colour Swatches:

                    Interaction Points:
                    Hover Effects: Buttons, cards and links should glow or shift colour subtley, 
                    sort of simulating light reflections
                    Cursor Tracking: I want to achieve something where the background elements move 
                    slightly with the cursor position to create a parallax, "responsive environment" feel. 
                    This is just a idea, I'm not quite sure if I'm sitting well with the idea yet.
                    Page Transitions: Maybe something along the lines of smooth fades or quick digital "glitch" animations when switching sections.

                    User Flow electric
                    Home → Portfolio: The aim is for the homepage to serve as a visual hook, but also since it’s functioning as my profile, 
                    I want it to guide the user towards the portfolio as the main destination (with clear paths to explore the essays, blogs and design section)
                    Portfolio → Designs: Portfolio pieces to prompt the viewer into the design section to get a sneak peek of the 
                    behind-the-scenes and show concepts.
                    Blog→ Essays: The blogs should kind of flow into the essays for a more deeper, 
                    analytical dive into my work.
                    Footer: A minimal footer with contact links, maybe styled like a control panel or status bar from Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S system
