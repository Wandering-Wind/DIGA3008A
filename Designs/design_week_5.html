                        As stated earlier, the goal of this website is to function as a portfolio that highlights my creativity and accomplishments, 
                        as well as skills and projects that I've worked on. Additionally, the website will help me navigate my unique style, 
                        branding and aesthetic <cite>(Fungies, 2023)</cite>.<br>
                        The goal is for the users to interact with my work, and explore projects that I've worked on/have been a part of.  <br>
                        The User: As stated, there are two types of users for this website. The lived-in project user, such as lecturers 
                        and tutors for this course, and the imaginary user that comes to visit the portfolio. Visitors would entail people 
                        such as collaborators, and any industry professionals. The users should be able to interact/see displayed projects 
                        and reach out to me. <cite>(Moritz Prätorius, 2024)</cite><br>

                            In order to structure my user interface, I would like to focus on creating an intuitive, visually appealing, and functional design. 
                            The input controls would allow users to interact with my portfolio. <br>
                            This includes:

                        Regarding contrast between values of hex colour value #045782 (foreground) and #b5d4ed (background): <br>
                        The contrast ration is 5, and it it's a pass on normal text, large text and graphical objects and user interface components.

                        Colin Moy's portfolio website is simplistic, creative and interactive. The creative ways to keep the user/viewer engaged. The one thing that I don't like the colour palette. <br>
                        <a href="https://www.karliskah.com/" class="u-url">Karlis Kah</a>
                        Kartliskah's portfolio is interactive and creative. I find creators who use interesting ways to keep the user engaged. The one thing I'm not very sure of is the footer, it's not very user friendly. <br>
                        <a href="https://side-scroller-8d0b7d196792c04b8abe98e11.webflow.io/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=SS-GoogleSearch-Nonbrand-DynamicSearchAds-Tier4&utm_term=dsa-1729073412468___703207072719__" class="u-url">‍Aaron Grieve'</a>
                        Aaron's website something I don't happen to personally be fond of. It doesn't seem very user-friendly, and intuitive. The colour palette is very light, and contrasting but it's very harsh on the eyes. <br>
