                        <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
                        As stated earlier, the goal of this website is to function as a portfolio that highlights my creativity and accomplishments, 
                        as well as skills and projects that I've worked on. Additionally, the website will help me navigate my unique style, 
                        branding and aesthetic (Fungies, 2023).<br>
                        The goal is for the users to interact with my work, and explore projects that I've worked on/have been a part of.  <br>
                        The User: As stated, there are two types of users for this website. The lived-in project user, such as lecturers 
                        and tutors for this course, and the imaginary user that comes to visit the portfolio. Visitors would entail people 
                        such as collaborators, and any industry professionals. The users should be able to interact/see displayed projects 
                        and reach out to me. (Moritz Pr√§torius, 2024)<br>

                        <h3>List and explanation of selected Interface Elements</h3>
                            In order to structure my user interface, I would like to focus on creating an intuitive, visually appealing, and functional design. 
                            The input controls would allow users to interact with my portfolio. <br>

                                        <li>Loaders (something creative to let the user know the system is completing an action in the background)  </li>
