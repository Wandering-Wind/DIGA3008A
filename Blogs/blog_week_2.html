            <h3>Reflecting "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" (2003) by Moulthrop and how it speak to the internet today </h3>
                <p> 
                    "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" was an essay by Stuart Moulthrop originally published in 1991
                     and then later included in the new Media Reader in 2003. Moulthrop's essay explores the concept of hypertext and it's potential
                      to revolutionize media and culture, which is DEFINITELY relevant to the Internet today. Moulthrop explores this concept through
                       the lens of Theodor Holm Nelson's vision of a universal hypertext system called Xanadu. 
                       However, I'd like to talk about the concept of "Hyperreality" that Moulthrop touches on.  
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Moulthrop discusses how hypertext challenges traditional notions of reality by creating a space where the distinction between 
                    the real and the imaginary blurs. This aligns with the Internet's ability to blend reality and virtual experiences through various digital platforms, 
                    such as social media (but honestly, is anything even real at this point?). Social media platforms create a hyperreal environment where users/content creators/
                    any IG users present a handpicked and curated version of themselves, where viewers may not be able to distinguish reality, the idea if that's even you, you know 
                    what I mean? This builds off on Moulthrop's idea that "referential or “grounded” utterance becomes indistinguishable from the self-referential" (Moulthrop, 1991, p. 694). 
                    These curated online identities become indistinguishable from their real ones; can you tell if your favourite YouTuber is actually that funny in real life or are they 
                    just reading a script?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now this is particularly interesting because you can connect this concept of how users curate this online version of 
                    themselves to Jean Baudrillard's concept of simulacra, where simulation replaces genuine experiences (Vieira, 2023). 
                    This can be seen in social media, where external validation overshadows genuine connections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, this can be taken another step further since AI-generated content can be seen on social media, 
                    and the lines between truth and falsehood are blurred (Vieira, 2023). This then challenges views of social media 
                    content to differentiate genuine experiences and AI-generated content.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, in Moulthrop's conclusion, he remains somewhat skeptical: 
                    " <i>Well, you know . . . We all want to change your head. </i>
                    The question remains: <b>which heads do the changing, and which get the change?</b>"
                </p>

            <h2>Additional Stuff:</h2>
                <h3>Discussing my folder structure and URL scheme, and outlining my decision-making.</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is an image demonstrating my folder structure. The reason for this is to organize where content goes and 
                    to make it more readable on the URL. I used simple descriptive words and did not use any ASCII characters so that it would be easier 
                    to navigate through. <br>

                <h3>Wireframe Ideas</h3>
                <p>
                    I am thinking of having a Homepage/ Landing page (my index.html) really short and simple, then having pages for my designs showcasing my 
                    wireframe. A page for my essay, and all my essays present but if clicked on, will lead you to a page that contains the whole essay and well 
                    presented. A page to hold all my blogs, and a page leading to each blog to showcase the blog posts in their entirety.
                </p>
