                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The digital divide-highlighted by <cite>Danilou (2020)</cite> and <cite>>Kasapis (2020)</cite> reveals how structural inequalities
                                     in internet access sustain marginalization. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Claire Daniolou’s <cite>"The Need for Global Internet Connectivity”</cite> and Spyros Kasapis’ <cite>“Internet Access is a Fundamental Right”</cite>
                                     through the lens of Design Justice, illustrates that the so-called <q>digital divide</q> 
                                     is not just a technological issue - it’s a design problem rooted in systemic injustice.
                                </p>

                                <p><cite>Kasapis</cite> asserts that internet access is not merely a utility but a fundamental human right-especially
                                     during time fo crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic. This sort of echoes <cite>Shasha Costanza-Chock's</cite> critique
                                      of <q>inclusive design</q><cite>(Costanza-Choc, 2020, p.53)</cite>. They move on to explain that it is not enough to 
                                      bring people into the system if the system itself reproduces inequality. Instead, Design Justice demands
                                       that a new system is co-created with those historically excluded <cite>(Costanza-Choc, 2020, pp.67-68)</cite>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Daniolou notes that 59% of the global population had internet access by 2020, leaving billions excluded 
                                    from economic, educational, and social opportunities <cite>(Daniolou, 2020)</cite>. She then goes on to frame this as 
                                    a violation of fundamental rights, particularly during crises like COVID-19, where digital participation 
                                    became essential for survival.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Daniolou also highlights how rural communities are penalized by a lack of broadband access, a phenomenon 
                                    she calls the <q>rural penalty</q> <cite>(Daniolou, 2020, p.3)</cite>. But as <cite>Costanza-Chock</cite> notes, rural marginalization 
                                    isn't a failure of infrastructure - it's a result of whose needs are prioritized in the design process. 
                                    The current global internet architecture privileges urban, Westerners, etc; because those are the communities 
                                    most often designing and funding it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A 2021 Brookings Institution report on digital service design reinforces this point by showing how government 
                                    platforms often exacerbate inequality through assumptions of universal connectivity and digital literacy. 
                                    Much like <cite>Costanza-Chock’s</cite> critique, the report highlights the tendency of digital services to center the 
                                    already-connected while blaming individuals for systemic failures. Rather than addressing infrastructural and 
                                    literacy gaps, many services unintentionally marginalize vulnerable users. The report calls for governments—not 
                                    users—to take responsibility for designing inclusive, community-informed digital services.  <cite>(McDonald, 2021)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Both articles touch on how internet access enables participation in education, the economy and social life. 
                                    Kasapis notes that without internet access, millions of students lose out on schooling, and workers can't "sell" 
                                    their works in the digital economy <cite>(Kasapis, 2020)</cite>. This arises a lot of questions to unpack. What kind of 
                                    digital participation are we enabling? Who controls the platforms and the narratives? Daniolou notes an important point. 
                                    She notes the danger of cultural homogenization online, where unique rural traditions can be drowned out by dominant global cultures. 
                                    This leads to a key aspect withing this Design Justice whereby technology erases difference in the name of connection, 
                                    then it becomes a tool of assimilation rather than empowering and liberating.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This insight is further supported by <cite>DiMaggio</cite> and <cite>Hargittai’s</cite> 2001 review of the digital divide, which emphasizes 
                                    that inequality is not solely about access - it’s also about digital skills, agency, and meaningful use. True inclusion, 
                                    they argue, depends on addressing the broader social, economic, and cultural contexts in which technology is used. 
                                    Their findings align with <cite>Costanza-Chock’s</cite> rejection of <q>technological solutionism</q> and her call for justice-oriented 
                                    design processes that empower communities through participation and literacy <cite>(Costanza-Choc, 2020, p.138)</cite>. <cite>(DiMaggio et al., 2001)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, that being said, both Daniolou and Kasapis acknowledge that access without digital literacy in ineffective 
                                    and might even be dangerous. Misinformation, manipulation, and algorithmic bias disproportionately affect those who 
                                    are brought online without the skills or protection to navigate it. <cite>Constanza-Chock</cite> argues that this is another 
                                    effect whereby community-led content is not prioritized. I believe the exact quote from Costanza-Chock is 
                                    <q>Nothing about Us, without Us</q> <cite>(Costanza-Choc, 2020, p.70)</cite>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   Networks and content for communities need to be built with them, a co-creation. The future of digital society must 
                                   be co-authored by those who have been historically excluded. 
                                </p>
