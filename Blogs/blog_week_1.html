                <h3> Setting up GitHub and publishing Pages.</h3>
                    <p>The process was relatively smooth, save for some hiccups. 
                    The first time I tried setting up my page and publishing it to GitHub, I then opened the link, only to find "Error 404.". 
                    Was I confused? Absolutely. <br>
                    However, a retry never hurt anyone. 
                    Of course, with the help of a tutor, we retried the mission, and I noticed where I may have gone wrong. 
                    When I created the file <q>index.html</q>, I spelled it with a capital "I" ("Index.html"). 
                    I believe this may fall under file naming case sensitivity when deploying to a server. 
                    Safe to say, there were hiccups, but it was manageable. Daunting? Yes, but not too shabby for a first.</p>
                    

                <h3>Reflection on the readings selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today</h3>
                    <p>
                        <!--Added the cite tag-->
                        In <cite>"As We May Think"</cite>, Vannevar Bush mentions several ways of technology that have become common to the modern-day man. 
                        He mentions how there is vast information in the world, 
                        yet technology may be able to compress that information into the size of a quarter of a table. 
                        We see this instance on computers storing information, hard drives that hold an entire library on it. 
                        This can be perceived in other forms of modern-day technology, such as the cards; he mentions, "The cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space" (Bush, 1945, p. 41).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        An interesting electromechanical device that Bush hypothesized about is <q>memex</q> (Bush, 1945, p. 42). 
                        This would store and automatically cross-reference all the user's books, records, and other information. 
                        This can be seen in that a person can cross-reference almost about anything with information on the internet. 
                        This device would come to mirror how we think. I found Bush's reading quite interesting because the internet 
                        has become such a ubiquitous tool to us that such intricacies are more often than not overlooked.
                    </p>

                <h3>Interesting things you have found about the history of the web:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>Flash</em>: was a software platform used to create interactive content on the web, ranging from graphics effects to streaming video. 
                        However, one has to download an emulator in order to view content created by the flash. Web browsers, of course, no longer support
                        it since standards such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Something to note is that flash content didn't necessarily make content easy 
                        to find since the content was locked to search engines, making SEO useless <cite>(Jay, 2017)</cite>. 
                        This is interesting because we now have AI assist tools on the internet to optimize our searches.
                    </p>
                    

                    <p>
                        <em>Web 2.0</em>: The shift from passive content to user-generated content is so important, 
                        and it's interesting to think about how <cite>Bush’s</cite> concept of editable networks is now embedded 
                        in our everyday digital lives. Social media platforms wouldn't function at all without users actively creating
                        content. 
                    </p>
                    

                <h3>Goals for this course.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Develop skills to build a web-portfolio, and just be able to build an eye-catching portfolio with the 
                        added bonus of learning the ins and outs of the internet and web. Learning UI/UX interfaces would be 
                        something to look forward to, not to mention cleaner coding practices!

                    </p>
