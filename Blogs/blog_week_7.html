                                <p>
                                    Pros: <br>
                                    The UI/UX has several ways of enhancing the online shopping experience for the user.
                                    The information structure is well organized. 
                                    The menu categorizes products and services into clear sections, such as Beauty, Health and Wellness, etc. 
                                    This sort of organization simplifies the browsing experience for the user, allowing them to intuitively navigate items quickly. (Joannb.com, 2017)
                                    The user has the ability to create a account, where they can also earn from their Dis-chem Benefit Rewards, 
                                    save address details and payment information for a smoother checkout. With this, they are able to track their order history and current status. 
                                    This definitley tailors the experience to allow for a personalized shopping experience for the users.

                                <p>
                                    Cons:<br>
                                    The alignment of content is not very consistent. 
                                    This can be seen on the HomePage, which showcases the Easter specials as well. 
                                    The ad block pictures are of various sizes, but do not have a coherent layout, 
                                    which results in blank white space not being utilised and breaking the smooth user interface.
                                    Below that is a display of 4 products, some sort of special, however, it doesnâ€™t seem to be very coherent in its display. 
                                    While the block cards are of the same size, the images displaying the products are of different sizes, not to mention that the text starts and ends differently on each block card. 
                                    This confuses user experience since it questions where they should click for the product, is it all the same, or are they different to each block card. 
                                    This results in a disorientated user since they face a frustrating layout.
                                    Some of the images cuts out the text above slightly, also adding to a more challenging to read user interface.

                                <p>
                                    Pros:
                                    The events are listed and filtered in order of date, starting from the closest event and moving further away. 
                                    This happens to benefit the user a lot since they are able to see the events which will be the most recent. 
                                    Buying a ticket is relatively easy and intuitive.
                                    The Home Page/Landing page has a structured layout that allows users to see the event and a little excerpt.
                                    <!--Screenshot image-->
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Cons:
                                    However, when you click on a category, e.g. music festivals, on a laptop screen, the entire list of events is only found on the left-hand side of the page. 
                                    This leaves the entire page, namely the Centre, empty with white space. 
                                    It leaves the user feeling disorientated and frustrated as it is not intuitive. 
                                    This sort of display feels like it was made for the smartphone since all of the information is pushed to one side one the page, 
                                    and this layout does not make sense for a laptop/desktop user. 
                                    While this is combined with images sometime sitting on other components as well.
