                                <p>
                                    Ethical Internet. An ethical internet means using the internet in a way that is fair, respectful, 
                                    and responsible. It’s about making sure that people, companies, and governments behave in ways 
                                    that protect everyone’s rights and treat others with kindness and fairness online. 
                                    <cite>(Markuula Centre for Applied Ethics, 2023)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the reading by <cite>Shani Orgad (2007)</cite>, they reflect on Roger Silverstone's influential work regarding 
                                    the moral dimensions of media, with a sort of particular focus on the internet as an integral part of 
                                    the contemporary media environment. The main argument I noticed is that Orgad draws heavily on Silverstone's 
                                    final book, Media and Morality (2006), and his earlier work on the concept of "proper distance", to explore 
                                    how the internet might be understood as a moral space <cite>(Orgad, 2007, pp. 35:36)</cite>.
                                </p>

                                <p><q>Underlying his(Silverstone) proposal for thinking about the media as environment is a concern with the moral 
                                    consequences of this space: as is the case with the natural environment, the resources provided by the media 
                                    environment can be used, misused and refused, distorted and enhanced (2006: 167).</q> 
                                    <cite>(Orgad, 2007, p. 35)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    According to Silverstone's idea of <q>proper distance</q>, it is a way to think about how we relate to others through 
                                    digital or mediated interactions, such as on social media, news platforms, or messaging apps. However, 
                                    <q>proper distance</q> doesn't mean being physically far or close, but maintaining an ethical and respectful space 
                                    between ourselves and others online. I believe it's about how we stay connected without losing empathy, and 
                                    how we ensure accountability and care in those interactions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We can do this by designing platforms whereby users aren't reduced to data points or manipulated for profit. 
                                    Like, for example, exploiting users' attention through addictive design or spreading harmful/untrue content 
                                    just to get clicks. I mean, just keeping in mind that these are real people on the other side of the screen 
                                    and treating them accordingly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    That would also mean that people's personal information should be kept safe and private. Users should be able 
                                    to control what happens to their data, and companies must be honest and careful with how they use it <cite>(Carmona, 2025)</cite>. 
                                    Therefore, that means things like security is important to keep people safe online, but mass surveillance can invade 
                                    privacy and take away personal freedoms. To be fair, governments and organizations need to be open about their 
                                    actions, have rules and checks, and respect people’s rights when using security measures <cite>(Iberdrola, 2024)</cite>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In that sense, it would also mean prioritising empathy over transactional engagement. We see many algorithms 
                                    today are designed to maximise engagement, you know, what keeps users clicking, scrolling, or reacting. 
                                    Instead, platforms should promote understanding and human connections, even if it's less profitable.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    On the topic of human connection, there should be an understanding that not everyone experiences online spaces equally. 
                                    Marginalised groups are more often targets of abuse or silencing. Here, there should be an aspect of fostering 
                                    <q>proper distance</q> which includes building features and policies that actively protect vulnerable communities. 
                                    This would look like moderation tools, reporting systems, and design choices that give users control over their 
                                    experience and visibility.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, there are still challenges and evolving standards that should be kept in the loop. As technology changes 
                                    fast, it creates new ethical problems, like how we use AI, big data, and smart devices. These could include 
                                    concerns such as the way that AI makes decisions (is it fair, is it biased), or how companies collect and use 
                                    data (is it too much, is it private?), and how connected devices affect our lives on a broader scale 
                                    (are the connections secure?).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To handle these issues, we need ongoing conversations. People from different backgrounds (experts, users, lawmakers) 
                                    need to keep talking about these issues. A need for updated rules and laws, old regulations may not be enough 
                                    for new technology, so there is a need for new ones that protect people. There needs to be a strong digital 
                                    ethics whereby technology should always respect human rights, be open and honest, and serve the common good, 
                                    not just corporate profits. All in all, this means we need to keep talking about them, update the rules, and 
                                    always focus on human rights, honesty, and what’s best for everyone.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In summary, Silverstone’s idea of <q>proper distance</q> is about creating ethical digital spaces. It’s a call to 
                                    designers, developers, and platform owners to recognise the humanity of users, design for empathy, not just 
                                    engagement, and safeguard vulnerable voices, ensuring fairness and dignity for all.  An ethical internet is 
                                    based on privacy, fairness, freedom, safety, honesty, and respect. As technology grows, it’s important for 
                                    everyone (people, companies, and governments) to work together to protect these values and make sure the 
                                    internet stays a positive and empowering tool for all.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I believe that it's a useful framework for thinking about digital ethics in our increasingly connected world.
                                </p>
