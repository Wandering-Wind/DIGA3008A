                            <h2 class="p-name">Christoph Lutz, <cite>"Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data"</cite> (2019)</h2>
                                
                                <p>
                                    In <cite>Christoph Lutz's</cite> article, <cite>"Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data"</cite>, 
                                    he closely looks at how unfairness in the digital world still exists to this day, especially with 
                                    new tech like AI (smart machines), big data, etc. He informs us about digital inequality in light 
                                    of new technology such as this.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The article pushes back against this popular ideas that giving people access to the internet or 
                                    digital devices automatically makes their lives better or more equal. <cite>Lutz</cite> says that is not true- 
                                    having access doesn’t guarantee that you'll benefit, especially when the systems you access are 
                                    hard to understand and possibly unfair, not to mention geographically swayed, as Greenstein et al. 
                                    mentions in <cite>"How Geography Shapes—and Is Shaped by—the Internet"</cite>. <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>However, <cite>Lutz</cite> does argue that access alone is insufficient, especially in a world where algorithms 
                                    and AI systems mediate more and more of our digital interactions.  <cite>(Lutz, 2019, pp. 141-142)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <cite>Lutz</cite> breaks his analysis into 3 levels of digital divides, the first, second, and third level. 
                                    The first level is those who can access the tech, the second being those who know how to use it well, 
                                    and the third being what benefits or harms those who use it (such as getting better jobs or being tracked, per se).

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   As mentioned, the first-level digital divide is about who can or cannot get access to digital tools 
                                   like the internet, smartphones, or computers. <cite>Lutz</cite> explains that in some places, like the United States, 
                                   certain gaps are getting smaller, e.g. more women and racial minorities now have internet access 
                                   than in the past. However, the problem hasn't gone away; especially around the world, some groups 
                                   are still left behind, such as older people who might not use tech much (this is important considering 
                                   situations such as COVID-19, whereby health notifications and updates came through technology). 
                                   <cite>(Lutz, 2019, pp. 142-143)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   The second-level digital divide is not about whether people have access to tech, but about what they do with 
                                   it once they have it. <cite>Lutz</cite> says that even if people are online, there are big differences in how they use the 
                                   internet, and these differences are shaped by things such as age, gender, and education. Now, these factors 
                                   affects things such as what platforms people use (some might use emails only while some may use TikTok primarily), 
                                   or how actively they use technology (like just scrolling and passively consuming content, while some may post, 
                                   comment and actively create content). <cite>(Lutz, 2019, p. 143)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   Moving on to the third-level digital divide, which focuses on the outcomes of using digital technology. 
                                   Lutz explains that some people get real benefits from digital technology, like better jobs, education, health info, 
                                   etc, while others get left behind or perhaps even harmed, especially as new tech algorithms mediate more of 
                                   our digital interactions (scary stuff, right?). The third-level digital divide shows us that the digital world 
                                   doesn’t treat everyone equally, even if they’re all online. <cite>(Lutz, 2019, p. 144)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   <cite>Lutz</cite> argues that digital inequalities research must broaden its focus to address labour- and big data-related 
                                   questions, such as the impact of algorithmic decision-making on vulnerable groups and inequalities in online 
                                   labour markets. He does note a risk that digital inequalities scholarship is being overshadowed by other 
                                   disciplines in key debates about AI, fairness, and transparency, and calls for a more open, exploratory, 
                                   and interdisciplinary approach. <cite>(Lutz, 2019, p. 145)</cite> 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   I believe <cite>Lutz’s</cite> framework can help us understand algorithmic bias. <cite>Lutz</cite> supports the idea of connecting with 
                                   critical algorithm studies, which point out that AI trained on data from wealthy, urban areas often doesn’t 
                                   work well for rural or marginalised communities—for example, speech tools that don’t recognise different regional accents. 
                                   <cite>Greenstein (2018)</cite> and others stress the importance of local factors to explain why some regions are more affected by 
                                   these biases than others. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   Not to mention that online work platforms like Uber and Upwork often focus on cities, leaving rural areas with fewer 
                                   opportunities and creating a <q>mobile underclass</q>. This supports <cite>Greenstein et al.’s</cite> point that while digital 
                                   platforms lower transport costs, they don’t remove geographic inequality-they just shift it around. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                   I do think that the critical implications could mean the emerging technologies could be new types of inequality in the 
                                   sense that the move from basic Internet access to AI-powered systems and big data analytics introduces new forms of 
                                   exclusion (e.g., smart speakers that do not recognize certain accents that limit user agency), meaning that new 
                                   research and updated policies need to address these issues. In addition, future research should assess how AI and 
                                   big data affect access to jobs, education, and health, and whether these technologies reduce or reinforce existing 
                                   inequalities <cite>(Imran, 2022)</cite>. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This shows the need for research that uses theory and interdisciplinary research. Lutz criticises digital divide 
                                    studies that lack theory and encourages using broader ideas and methods to better understand and tackle digital 
                                    inequality. Future studies could explore frameworks like <q>Access to justice</q> to bridge algorithmic fairness and 
                                    social equity <cite>(Kontiainen et al, 2022)</cite>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In conclusion, I believe that <cite>Lutz’s</cite> article is a call to action for digital inequalities research to remain 
                                    relevant in the age of AI and big data by adopting a more critical, theory-driven, and interdisciplinary 
                                    approach as well. He persuasively argues that without such engagement, the field risks marginalisation, 
                                    and the promise of digital technologies to promote social mobility and equity will remain unfulfilled, as 
                                    structural inequalities are reproduced and potentially deepened in new digital forms.
                                </p>
