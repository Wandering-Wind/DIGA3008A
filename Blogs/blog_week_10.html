                            <h2 class="p-name">Greenstein et al. - 2018 - How Geography Shapes-and Is Shaped by-the Internet</h2>
                                
                                <p>
                                    In the reading, <cite>Greenstein et al.’s</cite> core argument challenges the <q>Death of Distance</q> idea 
                                    that the internet erases the importance of physical location, thus arguing that geography 
                                    still significantly shapes how the Internet is built, accessed, and used. I believe the key 
                                    dynamics are the infrastructure that reinforces spatial inequalities and how digital connectivity 
                                    transformed economies, labour, and communities.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <q>What consequences did the spread of the Internet have for the geographical location of economic activity?</q> 
                                    <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, p. 1)</cite>.
                                </p>

                                
                                <p>To unpack the quote above, economic activity basically means businesses with a location like 
                                    New York, per se. Now with the spread of the Internet, distance no longer becomes a problem. 
                                    So what was the effect of the spread of the Internet? Did all locations have an equal rise 
                                    in business due to the distance problem being solved? Or did the places that already had lots 
                                    of economic activity rise more than others?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    But with more and more people and businesses getting connected to the Internet, where did 
                                    businesses and jobs end up? Essentially put before the Internet, businesses had to be close together, 
                                    like in cities, to talk, share ideas, and sell things. However, after the Internet, you might think 
                                    businesses could move anywhere (because they could talk online), but in reality, a lot of businesses 
                                    still stayed in big cities, and some cities became even stronger.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    See, the Internet makes it easier to communicate, transport, and search, but since every place is different, 
                                    it doesn’t help everyone equally. <cite>Greenstein et al.</cite> puts it like this: <q>The primary reasons why the Internet's 
                                    effect is different in different places is: local preferences, the availability of substitutes, and the 
                                    availability of complements</q> <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, p. 2)</cite>. In the sense that local preference is the likes 
                                    and needs of that particular place, if there are other ways (besides the internet) they can already do things, 
                                    and if there are things that work together with the Internet to make it even more useful (such as schools or tech companies). 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <q>Death of Distance</q> is the core of the Greenstein et al. framework. The framework talks about how it is 
                                    assumed that the Internet will make everything cheaper and easier (by the same amount), equally, 
                                    for all kinds of activities. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, some things are helped by the internet more than others, which means that not everything gets 
                                    the same benefits. Some activities (like communication online) become a lot easier, while others 
                                    (like shipping things) don't really change as much. <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, p. 3)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I then read on about the <q>ADOPTION AND USE OF THE INTERNET</q>, which is about how different areas adapted 
                                    to the Internet. They mentioned that people or businesses in rural areas or small towns can get a big 
                                    benefit from using the internet, and I agree because they are more isolated from the big cities where 
                                    there are more customers and resources; and the Internet helps them connect to this. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    From there, two types of Internet tools arise: basic and more advanced tools. I understand that some basic 
                                    tools, such as emails, have brought more benefits to rural areas by helping small-town businesses connect 
                                    to the world. However, more advanced tools gave big cities the advantages since they had more skilled people, 
                                    money, tech help, and other companies to work with, whereas small businesses in rural areas would have a 
                                    difficult time using them due to the lack of in-house experts, easy access to help, and IT departments. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As a result, according to the stats, large cities often have more Internet adoption. This was measured by 
                                    counting domain name registrations since domain names are tied to business addresses, not to where the 
                                    internet comes from. However, this method of research isn't the best-case scenario. I agree with the 
                                    framework since some companies don’t register domain names at all, and some big companies usually register 
                                    them in their city headquarters, even though they might have branches elsewhere. <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, p. 4)</cite>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, a negative I noticed was that bigger cities have more help available to them, so adopting to 
                                    Internet technologies becomes easier. Yet, it would be a lot harder and more expensive to set up online 
                                    for places without these services, and in addition, not all places have the same Internet quality, 
                                    therefore affects how hard it is for businesses to use online tools. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This creates consequences of the Internet for wealth and productivity, innovation, consumer behaviour , 
                                    and globalisation and trade:
                                    Wealth and productivity: 
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Big cities and wealthy areas have seen the most economic benefit, 
                                                like higher wages and better job growth, while most other areas haven't, 
                                                which leads to an increase in regional inequality.</li>
                                            <li>However, face-to-face communication is still important, especially for creative work, 
                                                so cities still matter. This is a good point on how the Internet allows us to do simpler 
                                                stuff online, but that still means we save face-to-face time for really important or complex things. 
                                                (explains why places like New York are still thriving)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, pp. 6-7)</cite>

                                    Innovation: 
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The main idea is that lower communication costs- especially through the Internet- have 
                                                changed how scientists and inventors collaborate, produce research, and where innovation 
                                                happens. Now the big question remains: Does this make innovation more spread out (convergence) 
                                                or does it stay concentrated in certain places (divergence)?</li>
                                            <li>While the Internet has made it easier to collaborate and increased scientific productivity, 
                                                especially in underserved or lower-tier institutions, there is an increase in cross-location 
                                                collaboration, but as it stands, research communities remain socially segmented.</li>
                                            <li>Additionally, in companies, the Internet boosts long-distance innovation, not local collaboration.</li>
                                            <li>Overall, the Internet helped make innovation slightly more geographically spread out, 
                                                but only in certain regions.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, pp. 7-8)</cite>

                                    Consumer behaviour:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>E-commerce benefits consumers, especially those in small markets or with unique tastes. 
                                            It does lower prices, broadens selection, and shifts how offline stores behave. 
                                            However, these benefits vary by location, and local factors still matter, 
                                            especially when it comes to what people buy. 
                                            I think this is especially true with the rise of mobile Internet use.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <cite>(Greenstein et al., 2018, pp. 9-10)</cite>

                                    Globalisation and Trade:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Information technology (IT) investments reduce the costs of global coordination, helping trade, 
                                        especially in services, and allowing firms to restructure supply chains. 
                                        While I agree that strong data is limited, existing research shows IT increases the amount of 
                                        work that can be done across borders, particularly for routine or digital-friendly tasks. 
                                        However, many forms of labour remain inherently local and non-tradable. 
                                        Therefore, I do think that the line between tradable and non-tradable work continues to shift over time.</li>

                                <h3 class="p-name">DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To summarise the reading’s direction for future research, while the Internet reduces important economic frictions, 
                                    its benefits are uneven across locations due to local differences in preferences and infrastructure. 
                                    Two big open questions remain: why only a few regions see gains, and how digital services trade is evolving. 
                                    As technologies like smartphones, social media, and ride-sharing spread, researchers can use their staggered 
                                    rollouts to study economic impact. Geography still matters—and will continue to shape how digital tools affect economic life. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
